				<title>Gems, rails developers cannot overlook</title>
				
				
					<description>&lt;p&gt;We are talking about some powerful Gems in Rails. So first of all what
comes to our mind is that what are gems? There are some well known and
common genre of problems that web developers face everyday. Take &lt;em&gt;user
authentication&lt;/em&gt; as an example. With technology, user wants to log in to
all the systems with one account (with just a single sign up!). Say, I
want to buy products from online but I do not want to create a new
account on each of these e-commerce sites rather I want to sign into
each one those with my gmail / facebook / twitter /… account. As these
common problems recur, trying to solve them again and again will be a
waste of our effort and this will take away the required attention from
the application we want to develop. Basically Gems are ruby software
packages which provide the solutions to these common problems. They are
not necessarily related to Rails but Ruby. Most of these gems are
available on github and developed by talented open-source developers.
Here are some of them, which will probably blow away most of the
headaches of Rails developers.&lt;/p&gt;
