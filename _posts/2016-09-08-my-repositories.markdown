### My dumb works are listed in the order of time:

I was pathetic during my bachelor in Computer science and engineering yet somehow survived that. Here is a list of things I have done over my time there, 

* In C++ we have really struggled a lot then to implement basic machine learning techniques as **Perception Learning** and **Genetic Algorithm**. Codes are here in sequence, [PL][1] & [GA][2]
* Compiler course was a disaster for me and after a ton of help from a friend of mine, he basically comes up with this to build a **Compiler Language validation** code in C++. [code][3]
* Damn those maths all around in **Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition** course. We (friends) did a lot of dumb things [here][4] in matlab like implementing **JPEG** and **DCT** manually. On our thesis we've worked on building some **computer vision based surveillance tool**. Codes are coming soon in **Python**!
* I've found out a way to create a project management tool in C#! Surprisingly the Engineering Management Course gave me the idea to do it using some maths. I forgot some of them now. Something like **scheduling**, **sequencing** blah blah ;). [code][5]

Then I got employed and developed web application there with **Ruby on Rails**! (Frist timer no worries :P )
