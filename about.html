Personally, I am passionate about coding with Ruby, Elixir (Newbie in FP though), Python, C/C++, JavaScript. A science enthusiast and my research interests include computer vision, image processing, machine learning, AI systems and big-data. I graduated in Computer Science and Engineering. Loved understanding and reviewing codes on any programming language, a quick learner, a problem solver and ready to make a difference.

2. Machine learning and deep neural networks
3. Privacy in big data analytics
4. Software engineering
5. Artificial intelligence and expert systems
