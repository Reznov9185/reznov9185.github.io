| Software Engineer      | Bangladesh | 2015-Now! |

In the tech industry, I have pivoted my career as a Software Engineer but I also happen to lead engineering teams for global technological competitors and built all-rounder tech-teams from scratch.

Personally, I am passionate about coding with Ruby, Elixir (Newbie in FP though), Python, C/C++, JavaScript. A science enthusiast and my research interests include computer vision, image processing, machine learning, AI systems and big-data. I graduated in Computer Science and Engineering. Loved understanding and reviewing codes on any programming language, a quick learner, a problem solver and ready to make a difference.
